1-   <!--  --> is used for comments in HTML, so look for username, password etc in that, it might be that developers had forgotten that.

2-  sometimes the username or password may be invisible, so check for that
eg: <label for="password">Password <span style='color: rgba(0,0,0,0)'>is 60379701b9</span></label>
here last 0 is for invisible  (if u try to select it, it will be highlighted)


3- Check for javascript code, there might be some comparison where certain variable is used and the value of which u might find somewhere else in the document


4-sometimes the username, password might be in some file and u might have to go to that location to get it.
eg: url is https://defendtheweb.net/playground/intro4

and password file is like this
 <input type="hidden" name="passwordfile" id="passwordfile" value="../../extras/playground/9d2K4Fw.json" maxlength="" placeholder="" class="u-full-width" />

then u have to combine url plus the location of the file to access the file

https://defendtheweb.net/playground/intro4/../../extras/playground/9d2K4Fw.json



5- There might be case where password prompts are coming, in that case look for prompt in javascript, password might be in that

pass=prompt("Password","");
        if (pass=="6c73b309b9") {
            window.location.href="?password=6c73b309b9";
        }
		
	

	
6- Somtimes u can edit html according to your will to show some data
eg: <option value="jTman">jTman</option>
Adding one more option in dropdown


7-Check for robots.txt file by adding /robots.txt in url path, there u can find the path of the file where the username, password might be stored.


8- There might be sometimes that hidden files are there which contains username and password and that too in binary format, so you might have to convert it into decimal, hexadecimal or ASCII using online converter


Binary: 011000100111010101110010011011100110001001101100011000010111101001100101   ->Ascii- burnblaze
Binary: 010011000111000000111001010001010100110100110010001101110100011101010010   ->Ascii- Lp9EM27GR


9- There might be some case like reset password, where u can change the already present value in email and give ur email


10- sometimes the password might be in hexcode, so we have to use hex decoder
eg: \x39\x38\x66\x39\x30\x38\x65\x39\x34\x35 on using  hex decoder changes to 98f908e945



11- Sometimes the url might have some query parameter which u might need to change

eg: https://defendtheweb.net/playground/intro11?input

when changed to 

    https://defendtheweb.net/playground/intro11?output
	
	gives the password in page source
	<pre><div class='center'>The password is: 7c47a5444a</div></pre>
	
	
12- Sometimes the password might be in MD5 hash format, in that case u have to decrypt it 

 <p>This one is simple, the password is <code>1c63129ae9db9c60c3e8aa94d3e00495</code></p>
 
 On using a online MD5 decrypter it changes to 1qaz2wsx
 
 
 13- Sometimes there will be a file which will contain binary data, Binary data can be either image or music file or video files, so try opening it with paint and it might show the image
 or try changing the extension of the file to jpg etc
 

14- Sometimes the user agent might not be accepted, so you can change user agent by going to 3 dot in console, more tools and network condition. Here u can select custom user agent


15- Hiding information in images is called as Steganography. This can be solved by opening the image in notepad and checking for useful information.



16- In some cases u might want to use POST method to send some password or something. So u will have to write scripts for that.

<form id="myform" action="https://defendtheweb.net/playground/http-method" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="password" value="9239550a47"/>
</form>
<script>
    document.getElementById("myform").submit();
</script>

Create a new HTML file with this and hit, u have to change the CSRF and token value as it changes on each refresh. eg.

<html>
<head>

      <meta name="csrf-token" content="062735f4b317394b7547c7002a6bb7386b4b60192e4e5b7099752036b5fc5a64">
        
      <meta name="site-static" content="https://zhr3.co.uk">
        
      <meta name="site-version" content="bd1e897">
        
      <meta name="sentry" content="https://c0d7211d33e24baca097e6f2e8fc33e2@sentry.io/1810260">

</head>
<body>
<form id="myform" action="https://defendtheweb.net/playground/http-method" method="POST">
	<input type="hidden" name="token" id="token" value="042b5abe3a34d6d1c5f34ef03d1996dd77e8db9c10fbdfc47cad13c6a0b7251f" maxlength="" placeholder="" class="u-full-width" />
    <input type="hidden" name="password" value="9239550a47"/>
</form>
<script>
    document.getElementById("myform").submit();
</script>

</body>
</html>
